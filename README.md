# doorbell_app

This is a project to develope a doorbell app for my autistic child. He loves pressing the door bell, so I decided to make an app he can play online, using images thaty have been separated, using Inkscape, into spearate component objects that react when hovered over or clicked with corresponding sound effects.

These images will then be applied to a web page using HTML and CSS and corresponding interactivity with JS.
